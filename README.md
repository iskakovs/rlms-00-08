# RLMS 2000-2008 Panel Data Analysis for Food Consumption

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project that analyzes the RLMS (Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey) 2000-2008 panel data to study trends and consumption behaviors related to food consumption. The analysis is performed using Stata, a statistical software package commonly used for data analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the RLMS 2000-2008 panel data. This longitudinal survey collects information on a wide range of socioeconomic variables in Russia, making it a valuable resource for studying trends and behaviors over time. The dataset can be obtained from the [official RLMS website](https://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/rlms-hse/).

## Tools and Techniques

The analysis of the RLMS 2000-2008 panel data for food consumption utilizes general panel data analysis tools and regression techniques in Stata. The following steps were performed:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned to remove any missing or inconsistent values, and variables of interest related to food consumption were selected.

2. Descriptive analysis: Descriptive statistics and data visualizations were generated to explore the overall trends in food consumption and identify any patterns or anomalies.

3. Panel data analysis: Panel data regression models were used to investigate the factors influencing food consumption trends. Various regression models, such as fixed effects, random effects, or first-differenced models, were employed to capture the effects of individual-specific or time-varying variables.

4. Interpretation and reporting: The results of the regression analysis were interpreted, and conclusions were drawn based on the significance and magnitude of the coefficients. The findings were documented in the project report or manuscript.
